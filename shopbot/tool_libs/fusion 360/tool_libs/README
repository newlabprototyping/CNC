These tool libraries are for use on Newlab's Shopbot CNC Router.
These speeds and feeds are general and not specific. 
Please select from the applicable material to ensure accurate settings for your job.
Available materials are listed in the name of the download-able files.
--
If your cuts, toolpaths, or set-up is specific, we recommend using these speeds and feeds as
"starter" settings. You should fine tune these (Gwizard is our go-to for tool settings) to ensure 
your part(s) are machined accurately and safely.
--
Your toolpaths will require specific configuration such as step-over and step-down, ramps, tabs etc.
If you have questions for how your file is configured, please be sure to reach out to a member of the
prototyping staff for support.
