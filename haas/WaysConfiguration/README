This folder contains a STEP file for both the table set-up and our softjaws.
##
This STEP is a file with our vises, soft-jaws, and tool probe -> these are rough but accurate representation of how our machine is configured.
It should be used as a reference for fixturing and/or confirmation of the standard set-up of Newlab's Haas VF2SS.
##
The Kurt Vise is a KURT VISE 3600V (with reduced arbor on Vise Screw).
The Renishaw Tool Probe is a Renishaw_OTS_LA-5401-2001.
##
Our SoftJaws are uploaded here as a seperate file should you wish or want to machine your own.
##
The vises are configured as LEFT and RIGHT vises respectively.
##
The BOXES on either side of the bed are representations of where the travel ends in X for the bed/table. (i.e. the tool's center can go to the center of the extrusion but no further.)
